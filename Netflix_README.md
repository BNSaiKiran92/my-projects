## Overview
This project explores the **Netflix dataset** containing details of movies and TV shows such as cast, director, country, rating, duration, and release year.  
The aim is to perform **data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to uncover insights about Netflix’s content library.

## Project Structure
- `netflix_titles.csv` → Dataset  
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter notebooks with analysis  
- `README.md` → Project documentation  

## Key Steps
- Data cleaning (handling nulls, fixing inconsistencies in countries, ratings, and durations).  
- Feature engineering (splitting cast, directors, genres, etc. into structured formats).  
- Univariate & multivariate analysis:
  - Content type distribution (Movies vs TV Shows).  
  - Popular genres across countries.  
  - Ratings distribution (TV-MA, PG, etc.).  
  - Country-wise content creation trends.  
  - Duration patterns of shows and movies.  

## Insights
- Movies make up **70%** of Netflix titles; TV shows are ~30%.  
- **International Movies, Dramas, and Comedies** dominate the library.  
- The U.S., India, the U.K., and Canada lead in Netflix content production.  
- Majority of content is aimed at **Mature audiences (TV-MA, R-rated)**.  
- Most watched movies are between **80–100 minutes**.  

## Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## Future Scope
- Apply NLP on descriptions to classify content by themes.  
- Predict movie/TV show popularity using ML models.  
- Deploy interactive dashboard using Streamlit.
